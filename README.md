# Structural Break Detection - ADIA Lab Challenge

This repository contains code for detecting structural breaks in time series data, built for the [ADIA Lab Structural Break Challenge](https://www.crunchdao.com/competitions/structural-break) hosted by CrunchDAO. The goal is to identify structural breaks using a mix of statistical and machine learning approaches.
